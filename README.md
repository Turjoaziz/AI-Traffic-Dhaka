# AI-Powered Dynamic Traffic Management System for Dhaka City 🇧🇩

This project presents an AI-based traffic control system using Reinforcement Learning to optimize vehicle flow and reduce congestion in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The system uses the SUMO simulator and a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to dynamically adjust traffic signals across multiple intersections.

## 🚦 Key Features
- Multi-intersection traffic control
- SUMO simulation of Dhaka traffic
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation
- Up to 35% reduction in wait time vs static signals

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
- TraCI
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Git & Trello (Project Management)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/code`: DQN agent, training script, environment wrappers
- `/simulation`: SUMO config files, network map, vehicle types
- `/results`: Output logs and performance metrics
- `/docs`: Final report, diagrams
- `video_demo.mp4`: Walkthrough and results

## 🎓 Academic Context
This was my final year project at Ulster University for the COM668 Computing Project module.
