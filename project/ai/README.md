# AI-Based Traffic Signal Control Using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements an AI-driven dynamic traffic signal controller using Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning and the SUMO traffic simulation engine. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and waiting time by enabling adaptive signal control based on real-time traffic conditions.
